Emergency room visits dropped significantly, and healthcare costs began to stabilize. But a closer look at the data reveals a troubling pattern that could reshape how we think about healthcare reform across America: the benefits weren’t reaching everyone equally.</p><p>A groundbreaking new study published in Frontiers in Health Services has uncovered a stark reality about Oregon’s Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs)—the state’s innovative approach to Medicaid reform. While urban residents saw dramatic reductions in preventable emergency department visits, those living in rural and isolated communities experienced far smaller improvements, highlighting a growing divide in healthcare access and outcomes.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong> • Oregon’s Medicaid reform reduced ER visits by 22 per 1,000 people monthly • Urban areas saw 3x greater improvement than isolated rural communities<br>• Rural healthcare systems need targeted support to benefit from reform • Technology gaps and provider shortages limit rural care coordination • Future reforms must address equity from the design phase</p><h2 id="the-big-question-can-healthcare-reform-bridge-rural-urban-divides">The Big Question: Can Healthcare Reform Bridge Rural-Urban Divides?</h2><p>The research tackles a fundamental question that extends far beyond Oregon’s borders: When states implement sweeping healthcare reforms designed to improve care while controlling costs, do these benefits reach all communities equally?</p><p>Oregon’s CCO model, launched in 2013, represents one of the most comprehensive attempts to transform Medicaid delivery in the United States. These accountable care organizations bring together networks of healthcare providers who share responsibility for both the quality and cost of care for their patients. The concept sounds straightforward—coordinate care better, reduce unnecessary emergency room visits, and improve health outcomes while saving money.</p><p>But as researchers from the Uniformed Services University and Oregon State University discovered after analyzing data from over 131,000 Medicaid beneficiaries, the reality is far more complex.</p><h2 id="real-world-impact-the-numbers-tell-a-stark-story">Real-World Impact: The Numbers Tell a Stark Story</h2><p>The study’s findings paint a picture of healthcare reform that works—but not for everyone. Overall, Oregon’s CCO model achieved impressive results, reducing preventable emergency department visits by 22 per 1,000 people per month during the first three years of implementation. That translates to thousands fewer unnecessary ER visits and millions in healthcare savings.</p><p>However, when researchers broke down the data by location, a troubling pattern emerged:</p><ul><li><strong>Urban residents</strong> saw preventable ER visits drop by 18 per 1,000 people per month</li><li><strong>Large rural communities</strong> experienced reductions of only 9 per 1,000 people per month</li><li><strong>Small and isolated rural areas</strong> saw minimal improvement—just 5 per 1,000 people per month</li></ul><p>“The beneficial effect of the CCO model on reductions in ED visits dissipates gradually with increasing rurality,” the researchers noted. This isn’t just a statistical quirk—it represents real people in rural communities who continue to rely on emergency rooms for care that could be provided more effectively and affordably in other settings.</p><p>The implications extend beyond emergency departments. While the study found no significant impact on preventable hospital admissions overall, the rural-urban divide suggests that comprehensive healthcare reform may require different approaches for different communities.</p><h2 id="policy-implications-rethinking-healthcare-reform-strategy">Policy Implications: Rethinking Healthcare Reform Strategy</h2><p>These findings arrive at a critical moment for healthcare policy. With 14 states currently implementing accountable care models for their Medicaid populations, and others considering similar reforms, Oregon’s experience offers crucial lessons about the unintended consequences of one-size-fits-all approaches.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure Investment Priorities</strong> The research suggests that rural healthcare systems face unique challenges that require targeted solutions. Rural areas often lack the robust provider networks, advanced health information technology, and financial resources necessary to fully support integrated care models. Policymakers may need to consider additional infrastructure investments specifically for rural communities before implementing accountable care reforms.</p><p><strong>Performance Metrics and Incentives</strong> Current CCO performance standards focus heavily on reducing preventable emergency department visits but don’t include preventable hospital admissions. The study suggests this may explain why CCOs had limited impact on hospital utilization. Future policy frameworks might need more comprehensive metrics that account for the full spectrum of care coordination challenges.</p><p><strong>Flexible Implementation Models</strong> Rather than applying uniform standards across all communities, states might consider tiered implementation approaches that account for rural-specific challenges. This could include different timelines, modified performance targets, or additional support resources for rural providers.</p><h2 id="who-benefits-most-understanding-the-healthcare-divide">Who Benefits Most: Understanding the Healthcare Divide</h2><p>The study reveals clear winners and losers in healthcare reform implementation:</p><p><strong>Primary Beneficiaries:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Urban Medicaid recipients</strong> who gained significantly improved access to coordinated care and alternatives to emergency room visits</li><li><strong>Large healthcare systems</strong> in metropolitan areas with existing infrastructure to support care coordination</li><li><strong>State budgets</strong> through reduced emergency department utilization in urban areas</li><li><strong>Urban healthcare providers</strong> who can more easily meet performance targets and qualify for shared savings</li></ul><p><strong>Limited Beneficiaries:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Rural Medicaid recipients</strong> who saw minimal improvement in care coordination</li><li><strong>Small rural hospitals and clinics</strong> that lack resources to fully participate in accountable care models</li><li><strong>Isolated communities</strong> where geographic barriers continue to limit healthcare access</li><li><strong>Rural healthcare providers</strong> who face greater challenges meeting performance standards</li></ul><p><strong>Potential Future Beneficiaries:</strong> The research points toward solutions that could expand benefits to underserved communities. Rural areas with hospitals large enough to serve as community health hubs may be able to repurpose existing resources to better support integrated care models. Additionally, targeted investments in health information technology and provider networks could help rural CCOs achieve outcomes closer to their urban counterparts.</p><h2 id="the-technology-gap-a-hidden-barrier-to-rural-healthcare">The Technology Gap: A Hidden Barrier to Rural Healthcare</h2><p>One of the most significant findings relates to the role of health information technology in successful care coordination. The study highlights how robust electronic health records systems and data-sharing platforms are critical to accountable care success—infrastructure that remains uneven in rural areas.</p><p>This technology gap isn’t just about having computers in clinics. Modern accountable care requires sophisticated systems that can track patient outcomes across multiple providers, identify high-risk patients before they need emergency care, and coordinate complex treatment plans. Rural providers often lack both the financial resources and technical expertise to implement these systems effectively.</p><h2 id="looking-forward-lessons-for-national-healthcare-reform">Looking Forward: Lessons for National Healthcare Reform</h2><p>As healthcare reform continues to evolve across the United States, Oregon’s experience offers valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and communities nationwide.</p><p>The study suggests that successful healthcare reform requires more than good intentions and innovative models—it demands recognition that different communities face different challenges and may need different solutions. Rural areas aren’t simply smaller versions of urban communities; they have unique characteristics that require tailored approaches.</p><p><strong>Emerging Solutions:</strong> Some rural accountable care organizations have found success by converting hospitals into comprehensive community health hubs, extending their reach across broader geographic areas. This model could serve as a blueprint for other rural communities seeking to benefit from care coordination reforms.</p><p><strong>The Path Forward:</strong> Oregon has already begun addressing some of these challenges through CCO 2.0, launched in 2020, which places greater emphasis on health equity and social determinants of health—factors that are particularly relevant in rural and frontier communities.</p><p>The research underscores a fundamental truth about healthcare reform: innovation alone isn’t enough. To truly transform healthcare delivery and improve outcomes for all Americans, reforms must be designed with equity in mind from the beginning, ensuring that the benefits of progress reach every community, regardless of size or location.</p><p>As other states consider similar reforms, Oregon’s experience serves as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale—showing what’s possible when healthcare systems work together, while highlighting the ongoing work needed to ensure that progress benefits everyone equally.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Falancalvert.github.io%2Fdamhealthy-publii%2Frural-healthcare-gets-left-behind-why-medicaid-reform-works-better-in-cities%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/health-promotion-and-disease-prevention/">Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/public-health/">Public Health</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/school-of-nutrition-and-public-health/">School of Nutrition and Public Health</a></li></ul></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/" target="_self">Home</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/about/" target="_self">About</a></li><li class="has-submenu"><span aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Signature Research Area</span><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/environmental-impacts-on-human-health/" target="_self">Environmental Impacts on Human Health</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/health-and-well-being-of-children-and-youth/" target="_self">Health and Well-being of Children and Youth</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/health-promotion-and-disease-prevention/" target="_self">Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</a></li></ul></li><li class="has-submenu"><span aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Academic program</span><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/athletic-training/" target="_self">Athletic Training</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/nutrition/" target="_self">Nutrition</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/public-health/" target="_self">Public Health</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© Editorial 2 - All rights reserved<br>Design by: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML5 UP</a>, Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script><script>'use strict';

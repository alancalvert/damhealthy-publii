One winds through tree-lined residential streets with manicured lawns, while the other passes colorful flower gardens and landscaped parks. Conventional wisdom suggests both green routes would inspire more physical activity than concrete sidewalks. But groundbreaking new research using GPS tracking and street-view imagery reveals a more complex—and surprising—relationship between the nature we see and how much we move.</p><p>A comprehensive study tracking 335 nurses across the United States for an entire year has turned traditional assumptions about green spaces and exercise on their head. Using Fitbit devices and smartphone GPS data, researchers discovered that not all green spaces are created equal when it comes to motivating physical activity. In fact, some types of natural environments might actually encourage us to slow down rather than speed up.</p><h3 id="the-big-question-do-all-green-spaces-really-make-us-more-active"><strong>The Big Question: Do All Green Spaces Really Make Us More Active?</strong></h3><p>For decades, urban planners and public health officials have operated under the assumption that more greenery equals more physical activity. This belief has driven countless initiatives to plant trees, expand parks, and create green corridors in cities worldwide. But this new research, published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, challenges this one-size-fits-all approach to green space design.</p><p>The study examined three distinct types of visible greenspace: trees, grass, and “other greenspace” (including flowers, plants, and landscaped areas). By analyzing over 304,000 ten-minute observation periods, researchers created the most detailed picture yet of how different types of nature influence our moment-to-moment activity levels.</p><h3 id="the-unexpected-findings-when-green-means-go-slow"><strong>The Unexpected Findings: When Green Means Go Slow</strong></h3><p>The results defied expectations in significant ways. Areas with more visible trees were associated with slightly decreased physical activity—about 0.36 fewer steps per minute for every 18.7% increase in tree coverage. Similarly, grassy areas showed an inverse relationship with activity levels, with people taking 0.59 fewer steps per minute for every 10.6% increase in visible grass.</p><p>But here’s where it gets interesting: the grass effect wasn’t linear. Physical activity decreased up to about 10% grass coverage (the 65th percentile), but beyond that threshold, the negative association disappeared entirely. This suggests there’s a “sweet spot” where grass transitions from discouraging activity to having no effect at all.</p><p>The real surprise came from the third category. Exposure to “other greenspace”—flowers, decorative plants, and landscaped areas—was associated with increased physical activity. For every 1.2% increase in these features, people took nearly 2 more steps per minute, translating to potentially 1,910 additional daily steps for someone with 16 waking hours.</p><h3 id="real-world-impact-rethinking-urban-design-for-health"><strong>Real-World Impact: Rethinking Urban Design for Health</strong></h3><p>These findings have profound implications for how we design cities and communities to promote public health. The research suggests that simply adding any type of greenery won’t necessarily encourage more physical activity. Instead, the specific type and quality of green space matters enormously.</p><p><strong>For Urban Planners:</strong> The study indicates that investing in well-maintained, aesthetically appealing landscaping with flowers and decorative plants may be more effective at promoting physical activity than simply planting trees or creating large grassy areas. This doesn’t mean trees and grass are unimportant—they provide crucial environmental benefits like air purification, temperature regulation, and mental health benefits. But for the specific goal of encouraging movement, thoughtful landscaping appears most effective.</p><p><strong>For Public Health Officials:</strong> These insights could reshape how communities allocate limited resources for health-promoting infrastructure. Rather than focusing solely on the quantity of green space, the emphasis should shift toward the quality and type of natural features that genuinely encourage active behaviors.</p><p><strong>For Individuals:</strong> Understanding these patterns can help people make more informed choices about where to live, work, and exercise. Areas with diverse, well-landscaped greenery may naturally encourage more daily movement than locations dominated by trees or grass alone.</p><h3 id="policy-implications-evidence-based-green-infrastructure"><strong>Policy Implications: Evidence-Based Green Infrastructure</strong></h3><p>The research provides crucial evidence for policy makers grappling with urban planning decisions. Current federal and local policies often focus on increasing overall green space coverage without distinguishing between types of natural features. This study suggests a more nuanced approach could yield better health outcomes.</p><p><strong>Zoning and Development Policies:</strong> Municipalities could require new developments to include specific ratios of landscaped areas with flowers and decorative plants, rather than just meeting general green space requirements. This could be particularly important in dense urban areas where space is limited and every green element needs to maximize its health benefits.</p><p><strong>Parks and Recreation Planning:</strong> Public agencies might reconsider how they design and maintain parks. While large grassy areas serve important recreational functions, adding more diverse landscaping elements could encourage greater daily physical activity among regular park users.</p><p><strong>Transportation Infrastructure:</strong> The findings suggest that bike paths and walking trails lined with diverse, attractive landscaping might be more effective at encouraging active transportation than routes bordered primarily by trees or grass.</p><h3 id="who-benefits-most-surprising-demographic-patterns"><strong>Who Benefits Most: Surprising Demographic Patterns</strong></h3><p>The study revealed intriguing variations in how different groups respond to green space exposure. The negative association between grass and physical activity was strongest in spring months and among people living in higher socioeconomic neighborhoods. Residents of the Northeast showed the most pronounced response to grassy areas, suggesting regional cultural or environmental factors may influence how we interact with different types of nature.</p><p><strong>Higher-Income Communities:</strong> Paradoxically, people in more affluent neighborhoods—where grassy areas are often better maintained and safer—showed the strongest tendency toward reduced activity in grass-heavy environments. This might reflect these areas’ suitability for sedentary recreational activities like picnicking, reading, or socializing rather than active pursuits.</p><p><strong>Healthcare Workers:</strong> The study focused on nurses and nursing students, a population that accumulates significant physical activity through their work. The findings suggest that even among naturally active professionals, the type of green space encountered during daily routines significantly influences additional voluntary movement.</p><p><strong>Seasonal Variations:</strong> The spring season showed the strongest grass-activity inverse relationship, suggesting that people’s interaction with green spaces changes throughout the year. This has implications for how communities should maintain and program their green spaces across seasons.</p><h3 id="the-science-behind-the-scenes-revolutionary-research-methods"><strong>The Science Behind the Scenes: Revolutionary Research Methods</strong></h3><p>What makes this study groundbreaking isn’t just its findings, but its methodology. Previous research typically relied on measuring green space near people’s homes using satellite imagery—a method that misses the nuanced, ground-level experience of actually seeing and interacting with nature.</p><p>This study used artificial intelligence to analyze millions of Google Street View images, creating detailed maps of what people actually see at eye level as they move through their communities. Combined with GPS tracking and minute-by-minute activity data from Fitbit devices, this approach captured the real-world relationship between visible nature and physical behavior with unprecedented precision.</p><p>The researchers also addressed a crucial challenge in environmental health research: distinguishing between people who actively seek out green spaces for exercise and those who happen to encounter them during daily activities. By using statistical techniques that account for individual preferences and usual activity patterns, the study provides more reliable insights into how green spaces genuinely influence behavior.</p><h3 id="looking-forward-the-future-of-healthy-communities"><strong>Looking Forward: The Future of Healthy Communities</strong></h3><p>These findings represent just the beginning of a new era in evidence-based urban design. As cities worldwide grapple with rising rates of physical inactivity and related health problems, understanding the specific features of environments that promote movement becomes increasingly crucial.</p><p>Future research will likely expand these methods to diverse populations and geographic regions, helping us understand whether these patterns hold across different cultures, climates, and urban forms. Scientists are also beginning to explore how green space quality—not just type—influences physical and mental health outcomes.</p><p>The ultimate goal is creating communities where healthy behaviors happen naturally, where the design of our surroundings makes the healthy choice the easy choice. This study brings us one step closer to that vision, revealing that the path to more active communities may wind through flower gardens rather than just grassy parks or tree-lined streets.</p><h3 id="key-takeaways-what-this-means-for-you"><strong>Key Takeaways: What This Means for You</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Not all green spaces encourage physical activity equally</strong>—flowers and landscaped areas show the strongest positive association with movement</li><li><strong>Trees and grass may actually be associated with slightly reduced activity levels</strong>, possibly because they create environments more conducive to rest and relaxation</li><li><strong>The quality and aesthetic appeal of green spaces may matter more than their quantity</strong> for promoting daily physical activity</li><li><strong>Seasonal and regional differences suggest that green space effectiveness varies by context and culture</strong></li><li><strong>Urban planning decisions should consider the specific types of natural features that align with health promotion goals</strong></li></ul><p>As we continue to build and rebuild our communities in the coming decades, this research provides valuable guidance for creating environments that don’t just look beautiful, but actively support the health and wellbeing of everyone who lives, works, and moves through them.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Falancalvert.github.io%2Fdamhealthy-publii%2Fthe-surprising-truth-about-green-spaces-and-exercise-not-all-nature-views-boost-activity%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/environmental-impacts-on-human-health/">Environmental Impacts on Human Health</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/public-health/">Public Health</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/school-of-nutrition-and-public-health/">School of Nutrition and Public Health</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/spatial-health-lab/">Spatial Health Lab</a></li></ul></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/" target="_self">Home</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/about/" target="_self">About</a></li><li class="has-submenu"><span aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Signature Research Area</span><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/environmental-impacts-on-human-health/" target="_self">Environmental Impacts on Human Health</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/health-and-well-being-of-children-and-youth/" target="_self">Health and Well-being of Children and Youth</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/health-promotion-and-disease-prevention/" target="_self">Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</a></li></ul></li><li class="has-submenu"><span aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Academic program</span><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/athletic-training/" target="_self">Athletic Training</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/nutrition/" target="_self">Nutrition</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/public-health/" target="_self">Public Health</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© Editorial 2 -

Why do some neighborhoods instantly feel more beautiful or relaxing when you walk through them? For decades, urban planners and public health researchers have struggled to quantify these subjective feelings about our built environments. Now, groundbreaking research has created an AI system that can evaluate the quality of any American street with stunning accuracy—and the implications for how we design healthier, happier cities are enormous.</p><p>A team of researchers led by Oregon State University has developed computer vision models that can analyze street-view imagery and predict five crucial aspects of environmental quality: perceived beauty, relaxation potential, nature quality, safety for walking, and safety from crime. By processing over 72,000 human surveys and training deep learning algorithms, they’ve created the first nationwide database of street-level quality metrics covering 120 million locations across every U.S. city.</p><h3 id="the-big-question-can-ai-understand-what-makes-us-feel-good-about-places">The Big Question: Can AI Understand What Makes Us Feel Good About Places?</h3><p>The research tackles a fundamental challenge in urban science: how do you measure the unmeasurable? While it’s relatively straightforward to count trees, measure road width, or map building density, capturing the subjective human experience of a place has remained elusive. Yet these quality perceptions directly influence our behavior—whether we choose to walk instead of drive, how safe we feel in our neighborhoods, and ultimately, our physical and mental health outcomes.</p><p>The breakthrough came from recognizing that while individual preferences vary, there are universal patterns in how humans perceive environmental quality. The research team discovered that people from diverse demographic backgrounds showed remarkable consistency in rating certain visual elements. For example, participants across all groups perceived greater beauty and nature quality in areas with healthy vegetation, well-maintained infrastructure, and thoughtful spatial design.</p><h3 id="revolutionary-accuracy-in-reading-urban-dna">Revolutionary Accuracy in Reading Urban DNA</h3><p>The AI models achieved impressive accuracy rates, correctly identifying which street had higher quality 73% of the time for nature quality and 68% for beauty—far better than random chance. This represents a quantum leap in our ability to systematically evaluate millions of locations that would be impossible to assess through traditional surveys.</p><p>The system can distinguish between streets that look similar on paper but feel completely different in practice. In Seattle, the researchers found two locations with nearly identical environmental compositions—similar percentages of trees, grass, roads, and buildings—yet one scored in the top 10% for beauty while the other ranked in the bottom 10%. The difference? The higher-rated street featured newer housing, better spacing between sidewalks and roads, and residential rather than high-traffic road conditions.</p><h2 id="real-world-impact-transforming-how-cities-design-for-human-wellbeing">Real-World Impact: Transforming How Cities Design for Human Wellbeing</h2><h3 id="precision-guided-urban-planning">Precision-Guided Urban Planning</h3><p>This technology transforms urban planning from educated guesswork into precision-guided science. City planners can now identify specific streets or neighborhoods that score low on safety or beauty metrics and target improvements with surgical precision. Instead of broad, expensive citywide initiatives, municipalities can focus resources where they’ll have the greatest impact on residents’ quality of life.</p><p>The data reveals patterns invisible to traditional planning methods. Cities can now understand why certain areas feel unwelcoming despite having adequate infrastructure, or why some neighborhoods consistently promote walking and outdoor activity while others don’t. This granular insight enables evidence-based decisions about where to add green spaces, improve lighting, enhance sidewalk design, or implement traffic calming measures.</p><h3 id="public-health-applications-that-save-lives">Public Health Applications That Save Lives</h3><p>For public health researchers, this represents a game-changing tool for understanding how built environments influence health outcomes. The data can help identify environmental factors that contribute to physical inactivity, mental health challenges, and social isolation—problems that cost the U.S. healthcare system billions annually.</p><p>Studies consistently show that people are more likely to walk, exercise, and socialize in environments they perceive as beautiful, safe, and relaxing. By precisely mapping these qualities nationwide, health officials can target interventions to promote active transportation, reduce stress-related illness, and build stronger community connections.</p><h3 id="economic-development-through-environmental-quality">Economic Development Through Environmental Quality</h3><p>The research provides powerful tools for economic development. Real estate developers and investors can use quality metrics to identify undervalued neighborhoods with strong environmental bones that could benefit from targeted improvements. Communities can quantify the impact of beautification efforts and green infrastructure investments, making stronger cases for funding and measuring return on investment.</p><p>Cities competing for businesses and residents can now benchmark their environmental quality against peers and develop data-driven strategies for improvement. This creates positive economic incentives for investing in human-centered urban design.</p><h2 id="policy-implications-building-the-framework-for-healthier-cities">Policy Implications: Building the Framework for Healthier Cities</h2><h3 id="evidence-based-environmental-justice">Evidence-Based Environmental Justice</h3><p>The research reveals concerning disparities in environmental quality across different communities, providing concrete evidence for environmental justice advocacy. The data shows that some demographic groups consistently experience lower-quality built environments, information that can support targeted policy interventions and resource allocation to address these inequities.</p><p>Policymakers can use this data to ensure that public investments in infrastructure improvements are distributed fairly and that new development standards prioritize environmental quality for all residents, not just affluent neighborhoods.</p><h3 id="transportation-and-climate-policy">Transportation and Climate Policy</h3><p>As cities nationwide grapple with reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable transportation, this research provides crucial insights into what makes streets feel safe and appealing for walking and cycling. The data can inform Complete Streets policies, bike lane placement, and transit-oriented development strategies that actually succeed in changing travel behavior.</p><p>Cities can use quality metrics to identify corridors where investments in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure are most likely to increase usage, maximizing the climate and health benefits of transportation investments.</p><h3 id="zoning-and-development-standards">Zoning and Development Standards</h3><p>The research supports the development of zoning codes and design guidelines that prioritize human experience alongside traditional metrics like density and setbacks. Planning departments can incorporate quality assessments into development review processes, ensuring that new construction contributes positively to neighborhood character and livability.</p><h2 id="who-benefits-most-the-widespread-impact-of-smarter-cities">Who Benefits Most: The Widespread Impact of Smarter Cities</h2><h3 id="urban-residents-seeking-healthier-communities">Urban Residents Seeking Healthier Communities</h3><p>The primary beneficiaries are the millions of Americans living in urban areas who will experience improved quality of life as cities use this data to make smarter planning decisions. Residents in neighborhoods identified as having lower environmental quality stand to gain the most from targeted improvements informed by this research.</p><p>Families with children particularly benefit, as the data can help identify and improve areas that feel safe for walking to school, playing outdoors, and building community connections. Older adults and people with disabilities gain from improvements in perceived safety and accessibility that this data can guide.</p><h3 id="municipal-governments-and-planners">Municipal Governments and Planners</h3><p>City governments gain powerful tools for maximizing the impact of limited budgets. Instead of implementing broad improvements across entire cities, officials can target interventions where they’ll make the greatest difference in residents’ daily experiences. This leads to more effective use of taxpayer dollars and measurable improvements in community satisfaction.</p><p>Urban planners benefit from having objective data to support design recommendations and evaluate the success of implemented changes. The research provides the evidence base needed to advocate for human-centered design approaches that might otherwise be dismissed as subjective preferences.</p><h3 id="public-health-organizations">Public Health Organizations</h3><p>Public health departments and community health organizations can use this data to identify environmental factors contributing to health disparities and design place-based interventions. Organizations working on issues like childhood obesity, mental health, and social isolation gain powerful tools for understanding how built environments influence these challenges.</p><h3 id="real-estate-and-development-industries">Real Estate and Development Industries</h3><p>Developers, architects, and real estate professionals benefit from understanding which environmental qualities contribute most to neighborhood desirability and property values. This information can guide design decisions that create more successful developments while contributing positively to community character.</p><p>Property investors can identify undervalued areas with strong environmental potential for improvement, while real estate professionals can better advise clients about neighborhood characteristics that contribute to long-term satisfaction and property value.</p><h3 id="looking-forward-the-future-of-human-centered-cities">Looking Forward: The Future of Human-Centered Cities</h3><p>This research represents just the beginning of a revolution in how we understand and design urban environments. As the technology continues to improve and expand to capture additional aspects of environmental quality, we’re moving toward a future where every planning decision can be informed by deep understanding of human experience and wellbeing.</p><p>The ultimate vision is cities that adapt and evolve based on continuous feedback about how spaces make people feel, creating urban environments that actively promote health, happiness, and community connection. In this future, the places we live, work, and play will be designed not just for efficiency or profit, but for the full spectrum of human flourishing.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Falancalvert.github.io%2Fdamhealthy-publii%2Fai-can-now-judge-your-neighborhoods-quality-better-than-you-can%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/environmental-impacts-on-human-health/">Environmental Impacts on Human Health</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/public-health/">Public Health</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/school-of-nutrition-and-public-health/">School of Nutrition and Public Health</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/spatial-health-lab/">Spatial Health Lab</a></li></ul></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/" target="_self">Home</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/about/" target="_self">About</a></li><li class="has-submenu"><span aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Signature Research Area</span><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/environmental-impacts-on-human-health/" target="_self">Environmental Impacts on Human Health</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/health-and-well-being-of-children-and-youth/" target="_self">Health and Well-being of Children and Youth</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/health-promotion-and-disease-prevention/" target="_self">Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</a></li></ul></li><li class="has-submenu"><span aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Academic program</span><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/athletic-training/" target="_self">Athletic Training</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/nutrition/" target="_self">Nutrition</a></li><li><a href="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/tags/public-health/" target="_self">Public Health</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© Editorial 2 - All rights reserved<br>Design by: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML5 UP</a>, Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://alancalvert.github.io/damhealthy-publii/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script><script>'use strict';
